Project Goals<br>
In this project, we were asking to build our own basic design system for a website.<br>
In essence, we had to build a website to help us build MORE websites in the future!<br>
On our site, weâ€™ll collect all the colors, fonts, and some of the repeating styles.<br><br>

I will update this site every month while learning web developement<br><br>

Here you will find an basic example of a Website build system from Codecademy<br>
